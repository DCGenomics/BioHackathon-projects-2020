# Contributing guidelines

When contributing to this [BioHackathon Europe 2020](biohackathon-europe.org/) [project repository](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020), please take into account the guidelines presented here.

Please keep in mind that these guidelines are not written in stone, rather they are a live document.

## Contributing to this repository

There is one folder per accepted project. Please *do not* create any new project folder. Project leaders are welcome to modify their own project as they see it convenient; we recommend keeping the overall structure so people will find all the main elements for all projects (corresponding to the call for proposals and including title, abstract, topics, leads, nominated participants, expected outcomes and expected audience). Feel free to add more items there (e.g., actual participants once you know who is joining and contributing to your project).

Please be aware that Pull Requests might not be processed. You are free to created them (for instance if you want to change something on someone else's project and ping them in the PR) but there is no obligation/expectation for PRs to be processed. 

## Contributing to the slack channel

You will get an invitation to join the slack channel, please join as soon as you get the invitation or keep the invitation at hand so you can join later. Only registered participants can join so the link will not be publicly shared. If you cannot find the invitations, please send an email to the [mailing list](mailto:biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org).

There will be some general and social channels. The general channel is for everybody, all the others you can join depending on your own interests. If you need to get someone's attention, please do not join them to your channel without asking first, please ping them first on the general channel.

Here we include a list of the open channels created by organizers:
* #general
* #social
* #random
* #1_BioHackOutcomes
* #2_DataStWizard
* #3_EpidemicBundle
* #4_PubDictionaries
more to come...
