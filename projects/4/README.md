# Project 4: Unified Biological Dictionaries + PubDictionaries = a curatorâ€™s life dream

## Updates

- First draft/spec of the work for the Biohackathon is [here](https://github.com/UniBioDicts/vsm-pubdictionaries).

## Abstract

The curation of biological information faces lots of challenges today. The constant refactoring of ontologies, nomenclature and identifiers, as well as the discovery of new information, makes the life of knowledge curators difficult, especially in the highly diverse biology domain. For example, expert curators who use software tools to help them with the annotation process, might come across a new feature or functionality that does not exist within an ontology or data resource that their annotation tool connects to. Similar difficulties are faced by biologists who want to quickly curate ...

**Project Number:** 4

**EasyChair Number:** 6

## Team

### Lead(s)

- John Zobolas <john.zobolas@ntnu.no> (AUTHOR1)
- Jin-Dong Kim <jdkim@dbcls.rois.ac.jp>
- Martin Kuiper <martin.kuiper@ntnu.no>
- Steven Vercruysse <steven.vercruysse@ntnu.no>

### Nominated participant(s)

Nominated participant: Jin-Dong Kim <jdkim@dbcls.rois.ac.jp>, who is the main developer and project leader of the PubDictionaries (http://pubdictionaries.org/) and PubAnnotation (http://pubannotation.org/) platforms.

## Expected outcomes

- Update PubDictionaries web-server API to incorporate the specification of a general VSM-Dictionary: https://github.com/vsmjs/vsm-dictionary/blob/master/Dictionary.spec.md
 - Create a new biological dictionary interface (https://github.com/UniBioDicts) that communicates with the PubDictionaries API
 
 The work during the Biohackathon will be split like this:
 - 1-2 day(s) to clarify the API specification and what PubDictionaries needs to change + the code update on the server side.
 - 2 day(s) to implement the client package that uses the above API.

## Expected audience

2 participants are required for the realization of this project. One developer from the PubDictionaries side (REST-API technology, Ruby) and one from the UniBioDicts side (REST-API technology, JavaScript). The first participant is the corresponding author (AUTHOR1 - John Zobolas), the second one of the project leads (see nominated participant).

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4 days
