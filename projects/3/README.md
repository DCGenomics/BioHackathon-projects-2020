# Nightingale

## Abstract

Nightingale is a project that provides a set of web components to visualize biological information. The first set of components developed is centered on protein data that can be displayed as tracks in reference to the protein sequence. For example, Uniprot uses these components to display protein features such as binding sites and other regions of interest, e.g. https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02042/protvista InterPro on the other hand uses nightingale components to display the location of families and domains e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/reviewed/P02042/ Similarly the PDB-KB ...

## Expected outcomes

- Develop components beyond the protein scope. E.g. using a genome as reference, or visualization of sequence alignments.
 - Improvement of existing components. E.g. A richer sequence viewer component.
 - Implement the ideas of the playground area as part of the components documentation.
 - Define themes across components using css variables.
