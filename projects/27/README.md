# FAIRification pipelines for (plant)-Genomics

## Abstract

FAIR principles provide guidelines to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital assets. However, they leave to the communities to specify the actions necessary for their implementation without favoring any particular technology or standard and to define appropriate metrics. The FAIRification process consists of the several steps which are described for instance at the GO-FAIR portal. Currently, the process is largely done using Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies which already provide operational means to enhance findability and interoperability of ...
