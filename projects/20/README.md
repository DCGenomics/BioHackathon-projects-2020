# *Project* 20 Support tools for efficient FAIRification of Data Resources in life sciences (29)

## Abstract

The Identifiers.org system is a central infrastructure for findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR) data. It provides a range of services to generate, resolve and validate persistent Compact Identifiers to promote the citability of individual data providers and integration with e-infrastructures [1,2]. The Identifiers.org registry[4] contains hundreds of manually curated, high quality data collections, with each assigned a unique prefix. A combination of the prefix and a locally assigned database identifier (accession) forms a Compact Identifier, [prefix]:[accession]. For ...
