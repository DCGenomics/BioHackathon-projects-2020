# Project 26: Sapporo WES as a Public Web Service

## Abstract

We have been developing Sapporo as a Workflow Execution Service (WES) in DDBJ. This system has been developed with an emphasis on the use of various workflow engines in a closed computing environment for sensitive human genome data. Therefore, it is not designed to cooperate with the other GA4GH API definitions such as Data Repository Service (DRS) and Tool Resistory Service (TRS). Extending the Sapporo system to follow these standards will make the system usable on a public computing instance, which can be used with the other WES implementations. At the previous BioHackathons in Paris and ...
