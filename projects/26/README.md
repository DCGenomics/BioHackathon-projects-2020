# Federated Interoperable Annotated Variation Graphs (39)

## Abstract

Variation Graphs are data structures that can accurately represent genetic variation in populations and across species. While avoiding inherent biases in linear reference genomes. We will use this hackathon to improve how variation graph tools can produce FAIRer data that is highly interoperable and reusable. We will engage with the (bio)container projects and workflow communities to present our computational outcomes as FAIR research objects. Interoperability will be improved by continuing work on SPARQLable views on highly compressed variation graph data structures. This engages with ...
