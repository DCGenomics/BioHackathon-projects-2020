# Project 8: Integrating modelling services with the 3D-Beacons network

## Abstract

3D-Beacons is a new platform being developed under the umbrella of the ELIXIR 3D-BioInfo Community. The primary objective of 3D-Beacons is to serve as a common portal that provides FAIR access to experimental and predicted protein structures in a transparent way, such that the data provenance is clear to the end-users.
Combining access to data resources that provide experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and modelled structures (e.g. Genome3D, SWISS-MODEL) will provide maximum possible coverage of the protein sequence space. To avoid ascribing the same level of confidence to predicted models and to ensure that both these and experimental structures are treated distinctly, 3D-Beacons will provide provenance information as well as a measure of confidence for predicted models. Additionally, the project also includes the evaluation of the applicability of structure-based annotations assembled in PDBe-KB (pdbe-kb.org) to related sequences and aims to derive a confidence measure for transferring these annotations.

## Expected outcomes

* Discussions on standardised data exchange formats to suit the various data providers, decreasing fragmentation of the data.
 * Updating the 3D-Beacons Registry with the required meta-information on new data providers
 * Implementation of API endpoints according to the 3D-Beacons API specification
 * Integration of the 3D-Beacons client for processing and converting model files to data exchange format (.mmcif, .pdb)
 * Extending the 3D-Beacons Hub to establish connections with the new data provider beacons
 * Developing a proof of concept 3D Beacon network of structural models related to SARS-CoV-2.

## Expected audience

bioinformaticians/scientific programmers (data structures, data access mechanisms, data processing pipelines)

**Number of expected hacking days**: 2
