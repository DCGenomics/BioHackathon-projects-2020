# Project 39: Unlock the value of your data computing at the edge

## Abstract

The exponential growth of high throughput devices, such as next generation sequencing or electron microscopy is generating an unprecedent amount of raw data that needs to be processed, analysed and exploited. The challenge lies in the capability to turn the big data produced by the life sciences workflows into actionable insights. How to do that as quickly as possible while ensuring that all data remains safe and secure? BullSequana Edge has been designed to meet these challenges, delivering powerful AI inference and streaming analytics capabilities at the edge. We propose you to prove the ...

## Expected outcomes

There are no rules or constraints; we want you to enjoy playing with Atos Edge, however, we would be interested in watching a demo of your work at the end of the bio hackathon. 
 What we want to prove is that traditional data centres and edge computing are the perfect blend to provide powerful analytics and machine learning inference capabilities.

## Expected audience

Researchers developing workflows
 Any research with an interest in accelerating an application 
 Galaxy users
 Anyone with an interest in exploring edge computing

**Number of expected hacking days**: That would depend on the nature of the workflow, application or use case chosen by the hacker. We would expect an average of three days.
