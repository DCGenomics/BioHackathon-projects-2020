# Open Life Science: Development of ELIXIR open science training modules

## Abstract

Science is most impactful when shared, enabling access to information, technology re-use, and advancement of knowledge. To foster a culture of sharing and inclusion within research, we designed Open Life Science (OLS, https://openlifesci.org/). It is a 16-week online mentorship and cohort-based training, where participants are supported in creating, leading, and sustaining Open Science projects. The first cohort of this program ran from February to May 2020, with 29 mentees and 20 mentors. Their projects aimed to solve technical and cultural questions in bioinformatics by involving ...

## Expected outcomes

- The content of Open Science training resources from the first cohort will be transferred from google documents to the website and made freely available under CC-BY license (currently listed here: https://openlifesci.org/ols-1), so others can re-use these materials for their own programs. 
 
 - New materials will be designed and drafted with the help of the Biohackathon attendees during the event to capture the useful resources from ELIXIR tools and training platforms, as well as different ELIXIR communities.
 
 - Newly developed materials will be integrated into the Open Life Science program and shared openly through its website. These resources will be used in the program in 2021 with the mentees of the 3rd and 4th cohort.
 
 - ELIXIR members who have been involved in the project as mentors and mentees during the first and second cohorts will be interviewed with their consent, and their perspectives and experiences will be shared with our future participants.
 
 - New members will be invited to join us as mentors, mentees, and experts for the mentoring rounds in 2021.
 
 - After the hackathon, we will write a white paper, targeted at F1000, to summarise OLS feedback and opinions from ELIXIR members and program participants.

## Expected audience

Required:
 - Anyone interested in Open Science and preferably with some previous experience of participating in Open Research projects
 - Interest to share ideas and skills that would be useful for early-stage researchers in designing and running their projects openly
 
 Optional: 
 - Knowledge of using git and GitHub (to work on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/open-life-science/)
 - Any previously developed training or learning resources that they would like to share with others through the OLS program

**Number of expected hacking days**: 3
