# Project 10: EDAM and Tool Information Profiles (17)

## Abstract

We will host discussion and hacking sessions on one or more of the following: 1. EDAM ontology (https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/) developers and scientists working together to scope and hack collaborative EDAM releases tailored for the needs of specific life-science / biomedical communities, for example targeting the annotation of community-defined portfolios of key analytical software. Scientific domains will include emerging and established ELIXIR communities, and others, such as crop research, rare diseases, bioimage analysis, metabolomics, protein structural bioinformatics. ...
