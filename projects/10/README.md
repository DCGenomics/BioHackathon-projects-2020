# Improving the interoperability of the core intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) function and interaction resources

## Abstract

The intrinsically disordered protein field generates large amounts of structural and functional data. These data are curated and stored by several core IDP data repositories for structure (such as SASBDB (Valentini et al. 2015), PCDDB (Whitmore et al. 2017) and the BMRB (Ulrich et al. 2008), and the DisProt resource (Piovesan et al. 2017)); and for function (such as the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource (ELM) (Kumar et al. 2020), the DIBS repository (Schad et al. 2018), and the MFIB repository (Fich√≥ et al. 2017)). A key goal of the ELIXIR IDP community is to improve the interpretation and ...
