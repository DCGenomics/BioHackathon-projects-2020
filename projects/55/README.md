# Creation of a cloud-native server instance that translates cancer graph variations into an OMOP compliant medical record format. (57)

## Abstract

We will create a cloud-native server instance that generates cancer graph variations and translates them into an OMOP compliant medical record format. The tumor genome is a combination of somatic variants atop a germline background. Germline variants primarily inform discussions of cancer predisposition, such as the election of many BRCA1/2 mutation careers to undergo preventative surgery given their increased lifetime risk for cancer development. The germline plays a particularly important role in childhood cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma (PTCH1/PTCH2 mutations). A tumorâ€™s somatic ...
