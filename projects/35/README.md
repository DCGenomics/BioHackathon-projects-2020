# Knowledge graphs and wikidata subsetting (55)

## Abstract

During the last years there were multiple biohackathon efforts to develop mechanisms which extract subsets from linked data. One example would be the G2G language created in a 2019 Biohackathon-Europe project, which used a mixture of SPARQL expressions and Cypher patterns to extract property graphs. An initial effort started during SWAT4(HC)LS to define the topical use cases and main methods. Later, at the virtual Covid-19 biohackathon in April, an initial prototype was started to use ShEx schemas to define the subsets to be extracted from a wikibase instance. There are several benefits and ...

## Expected outcomes

We want to create a knowledge graph extraction tool that will allow a bioinformatician to easily generate useful subsets from Wikidata or similar knowledge graphs based on ShEx schemas. Those datasets can be later used for efficiently analysing the subset data. They could also be used to generate reproducible subsets from wikidata and other large knowledge graphs. The prototype tool will be a WikidataIntegrator module that could be used to extract on demand wikibase instances for specific use cases.

## Expected audience

- Bio-data scientists and domain experts interested in data analytics
 - Researchers interested in open science and reproducible workflows
 - Bioinformaticians and programmers, or anyone with technical background
