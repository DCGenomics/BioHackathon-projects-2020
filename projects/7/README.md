# Querying and Visualisation of the Semantic Web Open Data Cloud

## Abstract

The Linked Open Data cloud currently consists of 1239 datasets that are interlinked with other sets in that cloud, forming a potentially extremely useful resource of RDF data. These data includes the most valuable ELIXIR resources such as UniProtKB, Ensembl, and IntAct. Whereas these data are very widely accessed through their websites, their consumption through SPARQL endpoints, at least by the average biologists, is negligible. BioGateway (www.biogateway.eu) is an RDF database hosted as an instance of the OpenLink Virtuoso, providing integrated access to these types of high quality data. ...

### Nominated participant(s)

Vladimir Mironov - vladimir.n.mironov@gmail.com

## Expected outcomes

The combined result will be a vastly increased utilisation of the large Linked Open Data resources, for biological network building and network-based systems biology approaches. A secondary impact may be the generation of a community that adopts standards to streamline querying and visualisation of semantic web data for network editors like Cytoscape.

## Expected audience

People with skills in scripting. Basic knowledge about XML, Semantic Web / RDF/ TTL formats, biological network building. Cytoscape (App) developers.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
