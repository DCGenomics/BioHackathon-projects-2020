# Taxonomy harmonization: Metazoa taxonomy use case

## Abstract

In DNA Barcoding and metabarcoding studies, the use of curated and well structured reference databases is fundamental to correctly assign sequencing reads to known taxa. Unfortunately, taxonomic classification is not well harmonized across the most commonly used reference databases. In this context, taxonomic classification alignment, correction and update are important tasks to achieve. Generally, the DNA COX1 barcoding region is used for animals metabarcoding experiments. The main data sources providing COX1 sequence information are ENA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) and BOLD ...
