# Project 22: Federating Accessible InterMine Resources

## Abstract

InterMine, an ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resource, is a platform to integrate life science data. The many InterMine installations around the world contain information on diverse organisms, including human data, model animals, plants and drug targets. An InterMine instance stores all its data in a relational database. This data can be accessed through a set of RESTful web service APIs, with direct support for many common programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java and R. In order to increase data interoperability and enable federated queries among different resources, we ...

## Expected outcomes

1. Generate a dynamic R2RML mappings starting from the InterMine core model
 2. Execute some queries using Ontop (or D2R server) and CovidMine resource
 3. Execute some federated queries using UniProt
 4. Run a set of complex sparql queries to verify that translation of SPARQL queries -> SQL queries works well

## Expected audience

1. SPARQL/RDF/Semantic Web developers
 2. People with resources with a relational backend who want to provide a similar mechanism

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
