# Project 15: Exporting rich metadata and provenance from Galaxy using RO-Crate packaging. (23)

## Abstract

Workflows are essential pieces of software for any computational research in life sciences and as such are digital objects in their own right, encapsulating methodological know-how. A great deal of work has been put into developing solutions to simplify the creation of workflows, functional annotation of bioinformatics software tools, as well as their virtualization, containerization and assembly into workflows for automatically executing the processes. This way, we currently have highly comprehensive and easy to use WMS such as Galaxy, enabling researchers to create workflows through a user ...

## Team

### Lead(s)

Ignacio Eguinoa (ignacio.eguinoa@psb.ugent.be) - corresponding author
 Frederik Coppens (frcop@psb.vib-ugent.be)

### Nominated participant(s)

Marius van den Beek - Galaxy Team member (m.vandenbeek@gmail.com)
 John Chilton - Galaxy Team member(jmchilton@gmail.com)

## Expected outcomes

Being able to import/export RO-Crate objects representing workflow templates and workflow enactments into/from Galaxy. Initially through the API and possibly also embedding this into the UI.
 Enable end-users to generate digital objects from Galaxy that contain the minimal provenance information needed for reproducing the executed workflow and deposit this in registries such as WorkflowHub and OpenAIRE.

## Expected audience

Ideally, the project requires experts with experience in the Galaxy code to be able to capture all details of a workflow execution, but would benefit from the contribution of any Python developer as well as the interaction with participants of several other projects: e.g WorkflowHub,RO-Crate and CWL PROV)
