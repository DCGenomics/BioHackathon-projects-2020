# Integrating modelling services with the 3D-Beacons network (15)

## Abstract

3D-Beacons is a new platform being developed under the umbrella of the ELIXIR 3D-BioInfo Community. The primary objective of 3D-Beacons is to serve as a common portal that provides FAIR access to experimental and predicted protein structures in a transparent way, such that the data provenance is clear to the end-users. Combining access to data resources that provide experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and modelled structures (e.g. Genome3D, SWISS-MODEL) will provide maximum possible coverage of the protein sequence space. To avoid ascribing the same level of ...

## Expected outcomes

* Discussions on standardised data exchange formats to suit the various data providers, decreasing fragmentation of the data.
 * Updating the 3D-Beacons Registry with the required meta-information on new data providers
 * Implementation of API endpoints according to the 3D-Beacons API specification
 * Integration of the 3D-Beacons client for processing and converting model files to data exchange format (.mmcif, .pdb)
 * Extending the 3D-Beacons Hub to establish connections with the new data provider beacons
 * Developing a proof of concept 3D Beacon network of structural models related to SARS-CoV-2.

## Expected audience

bioinformaticians/scientific programmers (data structures, data access mechanisms, data processing pipelines)

**Number of expected hacking days**: 2
