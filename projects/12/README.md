# Tracktor: genomic and transcriptomics plots at the click of a button

## Abstract

The amount of new High Throughput Sequencing experiments is increasing every year and bioinformaticians and data scientists spend a substantial amount of time processing, analyzing and interpreting these datasets. Due to the increasing demand, it is crucial to reduce or (ideally) eliminate the amount of hands on time in each dataset. Towards to this direction, the community has come up with solutions that include the adaptation to new technologies, the development of novel and more efficient algorithms and actively involving in the analysis and the education of the scientists who generate ...
