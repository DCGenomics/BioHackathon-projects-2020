# Introduction or Background

Add to this section a couple of paragraphs introducing the work done dring the BioHackathon, CodeFest, VoCamp or Sprint event. Please add references whenever needed, for instance [@Katayama:2010].

When sequencing DNA from an organism, it is standard practice to create voucher specimens [@PLEIJEL2008369; @https://doi.org/10.1111/jai.12568]. This ensures that the results are repeatable and that the identification of the organism can be verified. These vouchers are often stored in herbaria and museums, where they are curated and stored for the long-term. Similarly, DNA is also extracted from specimens already in collections, having been collected some time ago. In both cases, it is important both to be able to know all the sequences extracted from a specimen and find the specimen from which the sequences have been extracted. Yet, currently connecting specimens to sequences is extremely difficult without considerable detective work. To a researcher with expertise, specimens are identifiable by details of the collection event, such as date, location, collector, collector number and taxonomic name. But they may also be referenced by accession numbers. However, these fields are mostly just unformatted text strings in a database record and there is little-to-no consistency between these data in specimen and sequence databases.

Still, the situation does not have to be this way. Sequences in databases have URIs to uniquely identify them as do many specimens. It would be possible to create bidirectional links to connect these data permanently and in a machine readable way. Ideally, this would be done when these database entries are created, but this requires a cultural change by researchers. Furthermore, there still remains a large backlog of unconnected sequences that need connecting to their vouchers.

We propose to build a semi-automated workflow that will take specimen data from the Meise Herbarium and search for references to those same specimens in a DNA sequence database. This will be achieved by matching elements of the specimen and sequence data together, such as date, location, collector, collector number and taxonomic name. As none of these will be in the same format, we will need to find ways to match these data. For example, our herbarium has been working on connecting all its collectors to stable identifiers, such as ORCID IDs. If we are able to match person names on sequences to stable identities, such as ORCID IDs, we can narrow the search of specimens and sequence considerably. We can make use of the power of Wikidata as a broker of person identifiers, so that if we have one identifier in one database, we can use Wikidata to find other identifiers and use the full suite of identifiers to search the other database.

The outcome of the hackathon will be (1) recommendations on how specimen and sequence databases should be connected in the future (2) an analysis of the types of data available in databases suitable to find links and (3) the scripts implementing algorithms to match data. Ultimately, these outcomes will help any collection connect its data better and will support the Elixir goals of improving human and machine readable access to all data in the biological sciences.

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

Reconnecting the links between objects and the data derived from them is inefficient, error prone and expensive. Indeed, if rigorous data management procedures were followed it would not be necessary. Considerable work needs to be done to improve scientific procedures, infrastructural standards and scientific data management culture. Much of the followup work that needs to be done is to make these changes, so that there will be no need to reconnect vouchers and their data in the future.

# Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repositories and data repositories

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is
