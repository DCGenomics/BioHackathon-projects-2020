# The Turing Way: A how-to guide to reproducible, ethical and inclusive data research

## Abstract

Reproducible and ethical research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and different stakeholders of scientific projects are beginning to require that publications and research outreach include access to the underlying data and analysis code. The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. This is sometimes easier said than done. Sharing data and code in bioinformatics require a common understanding of the scientific concepts, data management, software development, and data sharing techniques: skills that are ...

## Expected outcomes

- Capturing important aspects of research reproducibility in bioinformatics
 - Documenting useful case studies and exceptions when managing and sharing data in life science research
 - Contributions to the collaboratively developed chapter on topics such as project design, collaboration, communication, and data research inspired by their projects
 - Bioinformatics examples to be added to the current chapters on GitHub, git, Jupyter, Binder, continuous integration, license, FAIR principles, etc.
 - Adding visualization and interactivity in the existing or new chapters
 - Enhanced visibility of the ELIXIR members as contributors and co-authors in The Turing Way project (current contributors are listed here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/README.md)

## Expected audience

Participants with the following skills will be able to join and work on this project:
 
 - Interest in contributing to an Open Source project through GitHub
 - Willingness to share their research skills and experiences in the form of learning resources, training materials, case studies of personal stories
 
 Optional skills: 
 - Knowledge of working with git, Jupyter Book, Binder, or Netlify
 - Previously developed bioinformatics resources that they would like to host on The Turing Way as a chapter of part of other chapters
 - Interest in translating existing chapters in other languages that their ELIXIR node and benefit from
