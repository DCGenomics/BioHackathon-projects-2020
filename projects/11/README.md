# panoptes: monitor computational workflows in real time

## Abstract

Bioinformaticians and data scientists rely on computational frameworks (e.g. snakemake, CWL, nextflow) to process, analyze, integrate and annotate data of various types. Such frameworks allow scientists to combine software and custom tools of different origin in a unified way, which lets them reproduce the results of others, or reuse the same pipeline on different datasets. Most of these frameworks allow the execution of workflows on cluster (SLURM, SGE) or cloud (AWS, Google Cloud Platform) environments. A fundamental issue is that the majority of the users execute multiple pipelines at the ...
