# Project 11: bio.tools integration and sustainable development (18)

## Abstract

bio.tools is an ELIXIR Tools Platform service which provides a discovery portal for bioinformatics software information. We will host discussion and hacking sessions on one or more of the following: Design a future smart registration interface which leverages EDAM and EDAMmap (https://github.com/edamontology/edammap) to facilitate tool description creation and improve the user experience at registration time. This may include the following aspects: - user supplies a tool-related publication ID, i.e. DOI, PMID or PMCID (or possibly some other relevant text or website), EDAMmap is invoked ...
