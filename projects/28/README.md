# Hardening and Testing Galaxy cluster support with BioContainer (28)

## Abstract

Galaxy is an open-source web framework for easy-to-use, reproducible, and shareable computational life science research, that is used across all ELIXIR nodes and serve thousands of users. Galaxy can run jobs using a plethora of different infrastructures (local, batch schedulers, container orchestrators, etc.) through different “Galaxy job runners”. However, support for different infrastructures through these runners is not uniform (some runners support certain features in certain infrastructures) and so it needs to be continuously updated and tested. During the Biohackathon, we will: - ...
