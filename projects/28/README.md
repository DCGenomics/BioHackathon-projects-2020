# Project 28: An interface between Galaxy and disease maps (43)

## Abstract

Analysis of ‘omics’ datasets in biomedicine is challenging due to their high dimensionality and a multitude of necessary processing steps. An important part of the analytical workflow is the interpretation of the results, allowing to select key pathologic agents, enzymes or drug targets. This interpretation can be greatly supported by visualization of the molecules indicated by the analysis in the context of relevant molecular pathways. On the other hand, visualization-based tools require a reproducibility component, allowing to recreate the process of discovery. Galaxy (usegalaxy.eu) ...

## Expected outcomes

- A working interface between Galaxy, the MINERVA Platform and WikiPathways
 
 - Two new Galaxy workflows for visualization of analysis results on the diagrams of choice
 
 - New capabilities for two user groups: Galaxy, MINERVA and WikiPathways, for better analytics and visualization of biomedical data.
 
 - An application of the new capabilities using PanCanNet (https://www.pancan.org) to facilitate and speed up the functional analysis of multi-omics experimental results generated by medical researchers.
 
 - A peer-reviewed publication based on the outcomes of the workshop, and finalized afterwards.
