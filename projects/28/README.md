# Project 28: Beacon for clinical and translational data’

## Abstract

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Beacon Project has shown its great potential in federated discovery of genomic data. It is originally implemented as a tool to share aggregated information (the “existence“) of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in distributed genomic data collections. This has been later on extended to other types of genomic variants such as structural variants (the “Beacon+”). The ELIXIR team across several nodes has developed a reference implementation of the Beacon protocol. The Beacon protocol has evolved towards more complex applications ...

## Expected outcomes

We look forward to the development of:
 Example implementation of API to report the existence and summary statistics of clinical/phenotypic information.
 Example implementation of API to report the existence of transcriptomics data (as an example of other OMICs data types)
 A set of core filters (with ontology links) based on the test datasets (public) that could be extended in the future by the community.
 We are planning to submit a manuscript on Biohackathon outcome. Between the potential achievements, we could find an extended and lasting collaboration between institutions as well as scientific contributions, exploring the deployment of joint multi-institutional services.

## Expected audience

Bioinformaticians and developers working in the areas of API development, ontology, clinical and transcriptomics data processing/analysis.
  
 By all means, organisers commit to the proposal with the participation and contribution of Beacon experts, developers, bioinformaticians for the event to ensure the presence of enough human resources and provide momentum during the biohackathon. 3 people from the University of Luxembourg 2 from BSC and 3 from CRG will participate in this Biohackathon topic.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4 days
