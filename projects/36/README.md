# Project 36: V-pipe applied to SARS-CoV-2 --- Interlinking reports with other databases

## Abstract

[V-pipe](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/V-pipe) (a SIB Software Resource) is a bioinformatics pipeline for high throughput sequencing of Viral genomes.
It takes raw reads as input, performs quality control, read alignment and produces consensus sequences and analyses intra-host variations: SNVs and haplotypes at both local (windows) level and global level.
Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has been [applied](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/V-pipe/sars-cov-2/) ([SIB video](https://youtu.be/pIby1UooK94)) to a large-scale [sequencing project in Switzerland](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland?f_author=Christian%20Beisel%20et%20al&f_country=Switzerland&p=grid) (it currently processes ~75% of all samples in Switzerland) ([UCSD poster](https://youtu.be/6pGljUXw1Do)).
More user-friendly features have also been recently added, including single command installation and [interactive visualizations of the result](https://v-pipe-viz.netlify.app/).
The purpose of the present _Biohackathon project_ is to enable outbound links between the reports generated by V-pipe and various [SIB Database Resources](https://www.sib.swiss/about-sib/news/10660-sib-resources-supporting-sars-cov-2-research) such as, e.g.: the [interactive 3D protein structures available at Swiss Model](https://beta.swissmodel.expasy.org/).
Challenges include the need for the reports themselves to work as local HTML files (V-pipe is also used for sensitive viruses such as HIV which precludes public servers), and most of the considered resources relying on HTTP POST API which is limited for local files.

## Expected outcomes  

- Ability to look up variants in databases such as Swiss Model, (see: [this SIB inventory](https://www.sib.swiss/about-sib/news/10660-sib-resources-supporting-sars-cov-2-research))
- Small proof-of-concept web servlet that can translate GET requests into the API of databases.  
- Cohort-wide visualisations.  (Mapping entropy hot-spot to the 3D structures).

## Expected audience

Python, HTML, Javascript, Snakemake, Virology

**Number of expected hacking days:** 3
