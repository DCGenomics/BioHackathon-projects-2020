# ELIXIR Service Bundle for Epidemic Response

## Abstract

In the last few decades we have seen the surfacing and spreading of many novel pathogenic viruses. Some were mutations of the traditional influenza viruses, and some were viruses that crossed the animal-human divide and became a threat to human lives. An example of the former is the influenza A (H1N1) virus that caused a pandemic in 2009 [1], while an example of the latter are highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9), A(H5N1), and A(H5N6), low pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N2), swine influenza A(H1N2)v and A(H3N2) [2]. In he above cases, when a novel virus or bacterial strain for which ...

## Expected outcomes

The ideal final outcome would be a draft ELIXIR Service Bundle that can link together different workflows, tools and literature resources, and can provide a platform for a quick response in case of an outbreak, for example finding candidates for drug retargeting or finding phenotypes naturally resistant to the infection.
