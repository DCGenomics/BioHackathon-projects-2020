# Project 5: Detection of epimutations to improve the diagnosis of rare diseases (8)

## Abstract

ELIXIR’s rare disease community aims to facilitate tools to researchers for rare disease research. Currently, most available tools explore genetic and genomic mutations. Although these variants have provided a diagnosis for many patients and families, around 60% of the cases still remained undiagnosed (Lionel et al, 2018). Aberrant methylation can be an underlying cause of undiagnosed patients, either as a primary event (a.k.a. epimutation) or as a functional consequence of chromatin dysregulation by genetic or environmental agents (a.k.a. episignature). Epimutations are the cause of some ...

## Expected outcomes

A working prototype of our tool, which would allow running a full epimutation analysis. We propose the following tasks during the hackathon:
 1. Discuss different statistical approaches to address the problem, including some approaches proposed by the team leaders.
 2. Apply approaches discussed in point 1 to public DNA methylation datasets with cases and control samples.
 3. Implement the best performing approach in a R package, following Bioconductor guidelines
 Further work will be done to fully test tool parameters and to submit the package to Bioconductor.

## Expected audience

Researchers with knowledge of biostatistics
 Researchers with experience in software development and plots design.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4 days
