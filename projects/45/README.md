# Design of a modular learning path (curriculum) in Data Stewardship, Management and Analysis for the Life Sciences (47)

## Abstract

In the context of ELIXIR-CONVERGE, a pilot Learning Path (LP) in Data Stewardship, Management and Analysis (DSMA) for the Life Sciences will be designed (phase 1), delivered (phase 2) and assessed (phase 3). This task will build on the experience and expertise of ELIXIR nodes and CONVERGE WPs. The LP will consist of a set of learning modules, which can be also attended as independent training events by users who only need to fill specific gaps. This BH project focuses on phase 1. It consists in a collaborative curriculum design activity that will pave the road for the development of ...

## Expected outcomes

A curriculum in Data Stewardship, Management and Analysis for the Life Sciences to be implemented in 2021-2022 and a plan to deliver it. This activity will lead, for each module, to the identification of:
 1) Desired KSAs and LOs;
 2) Learning Experiences (LEs) supporting the achievement of LOs;
 3) Content leading to LOs;
 4) Formative and summative assessments.

## Expected audience

Curriculum developers, trainers, training providers from ELIXIR nodes involved in CONVERGE, in particular involved in the development of a comprehensive ELIXIR Training programme in Data Stewardship, Management and Analysis. The programme is directed to a data-driven life science community to support ELIXIR users such as data managers and data scientists. The DSMA programme will also couple to the national training programmes in Data management and Data Driven life science across the ELIXIR nodes.
