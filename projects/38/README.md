# Accelerating integrated use of biomedical databases through semantic data modeling (58)

## Abstract

From the interpretation of variant to large scale data sciences, it is essential to use biomedical databases in an integrated manner. For this purpose, we produced Resource Description Framework (RDF) datasets in the Med2RDF project (http://med2rdf.org/) including ClinVar, ExAC/gnomAD, ICGC, CIViC, DGIdb, HiNT, INstruct, CCLE, dbNSFP, MedGen, and HGNC. However, the utilization of integrated data was still hard for users (especially non-engineers) due to a lack of the best tooling to capture the complex data models. Actually, although RDF datasets have been constructed around the world, they ...
