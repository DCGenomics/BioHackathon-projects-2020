# Project 38: Wine (Ontology) Tasting: testing technicality in practicality for the food industry

## Abstract

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1buY6kI4ysiD8g6PoFYyknHZnaSDfdGfIszd04J9kVLM/edit# Machine learning in high-variability areas, such as food and nutrition, is a very complex problem. Data mining with machine learning is an urgency for the study of dietary intolerance and allergies, especially when accurate labeling is required by laws. Large-scale databasing also introduces demands for structuring information of manufacturer’s data. Lack of semantic implementation to structure food data is a resolvable challenge that can be overcome by using existing technologies equipped with knowledge ...

### Nominated participant(s)

- local wine expert (to be named)

## Expected outcomes

1) A summary of findings - Pros & Cons of each wine ontology examined and their capability of data integration and interoperability.
 2) The test dataset that is curated and mapped to existing wine ontology (-ies) with a follow-up plan of technical implementation at the wine merchant’s database.
 3) A report of interoperability between the wine ontologies and Food Ontology for reuse of FoodOn as an application ontology in the practice.

## Expected audience

- members learning database curation by ontologies
 - building application ontologies

**Number of expected hacking days**: 2-4
