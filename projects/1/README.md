# Project 1: Follow-up analysis on BioHackathon-Europe outcomes

## Abstract

One of the recurring questions when it comes to BioHackathons is how to measure their impact. In order to do so, we first need to understand the outcomes from a BioHackathon. Some possible outcomes are software, publications and collaborations. Such outcomes could be analyzed from activity post-hackathon on GitHub repositories as well as publications generated out of BioHackathon topics. For the particular case of the BioHackathon-Europe, which has been running only for two years now, we propose to focus on GitHub activity post-BioHackathon. We want to learn about what happens with the ...

## Expected outcomes 

Note: we are starting from zero --sort of

* Brainstorming
  * Initial assessment on what BioHackathon-Europe outcomes should be targeted
  * Initial assessment on what analyses should be performed
  * Preliminary data model
  
* Development  
  * Preliminary data model
  * Initial metadata extraction from GitHub
    * Let's try first with the BioHackathon project repository 
    * Let's go later for repositories belongin to people added as members of the BioHackathon projects repository
    * We want to get a prototype on data gathering from GitHub
  * How can we browse/view/analyze the gathered metadata?
    * Representation on a knowledge graph with query capabilities
    * Data on Elastic Search with some basic search functionality
    * Some graphics or plots to get a general idea on what we have there

## Expected audience

* People who has participated in a BioHackathon and interested in following up software outcomes from it
* People with some knowledge on software citation and versioning on GitHub
* People with some knowledge on GitHub API
* People with some knowledge on RDF triple stores or other graph databases

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4 days


### GitHub repo and development

* Let's work in Python (Jupyter notebooks or Python files, TBD)
* Some projects that might be useful
