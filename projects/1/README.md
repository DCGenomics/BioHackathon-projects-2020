# Follow-up analysis on BioHackathon-Europe outcomes

## Abstract

One of the recurring questions when it comes to BioHackathons is how to measure their impact. In order to do so, we first need to understand the outcomes from a BioHackathon. Some possible outcomes are software, publications and collaborations. Such outcomes could be analyzed from activity post-hackathon on GitHub repositories as well as publications generated out of BioHackathon topics. For the particular case of the BioHackathon-Europe, which has been running only for two years now, we propose to focus on GitHub activity post-BioHackathon. We want to learn about what happens with the ...
