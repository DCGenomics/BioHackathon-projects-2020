# Interactive workflows to model ssRNA-protein interactions, applied to SARS-Cov-2 targets

## Abstract

As a workflow management system, Seamless (http://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless) is unusual since the workflow is continuously executed while being defined. Data, source code, schemas and UX can all be changed on the fly, as they are all first-class citizens of the workflow. Such agility is an advantage when tools and data are constantly in flux, such as the present flurry of research activity around the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The project aims to create two interactive workflows to model the 3D structure of protein-bound single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) for two SARS-CoV-2 proteins which unbound ...

## Expected outcomes

An interactive protocol and web interface for the modeling the 3D structure of protein-bound ssRNA for two SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Eventually, this will become a generic web service for modeling the 3D structure of ssRNA complexes.
 
 For the rest, the expected outcome is dependent on how much information will be available on the two SARS-CoV-2 proteins in November. It will also depend of the expertise of the participants. For goal 2b, the expertise within our lab is sufficient, and we are happy to share it with any participant who is interested. Conversely, we hope to attract the interest of participants with experience with workflows and interoperability, in particular to achieve goal 3. We hope that Seamless brings something useful to the table. Still, Seamless is a young project and we hope to profit from the best practices developed in the ELIXIR community over the years.

## Expected audience

Participation of at least three PhD students and two post-docs from structural bioinformatics labs of the RNAct consortium (http://rnact.eu/) is confirmed. For goals 2a and 3, we hope for help from engineers/researchers in general bioinformatics, in particular developers of workflows. Experts in data mining/annotation would be helpful for goal 1. For goal 3, we hope for experts in UX and scientific visualization.
