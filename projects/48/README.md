# Deploying biocontainers in orchestration environments for life science research (50)

## Abstract

Packaging tools in containers is becoming a common practice in bioinformatics to ensure reproducible research. However, usage of orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, is in the community not yet broadly adopted. EOSC-Life is planning to provide such environments as part of the compute resources, which implies we need to enable developers to take advantage of them. In this Hackathon depending on the knowledge of participants we will start with introducing Kubernetes and helm charts environments for biocontainers by deploying some sample containers. We will also see minimal ...
