# Epidemiology and monitoring ontology for COVID-19

## Abstract

Epidemiological data is necessary to monitor public health, and to assess the impact of disease outbreaks and efficacy of mitigating interventions. In the context of an infectious disease outbreak it is imperative to have these data as FAIR as possible to facilitate rapid analysis to support timely evidence-based decision making. During the past virtual BioHackathon-COVID-19 we evaluated the availability of some epidemiological quantitative indicators in OBO ontologies and detected that while between the Statistics ontology [1] and Epidemiology Ontology (EPO) we have many of the usual ...

## Expected outcomes

Expected outcomes and prioritization: First to develop an epidemiology information model in OBO focused on quantitative indicators; Incorporate this model in an existing resource for the community.
 
 From the first list of epidemiological quantitative terms analyzed, our plan is to: 1) add new COVID-19 relevant content through manual extraction from publications in medrXiv and or case report forms 2) try to map these to existing OBO ontologies 3) refine the list of terms with epidemiologists 4) define and implement axiom patterns 5) contact ontology stakeholders to define what is missing and either to ask for extensions to existing ontologies or to build a new, logically well-formed, and accurate ontology in OBO. We plan to perform two rounds of work, a first round to focus on quantitative indicators and a second round to expand to other indicators such as WHO indicators [3].
