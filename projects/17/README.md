# *Project* 17 The ELIXIR Cloud & AAI Platform: Operationalising GA4GH Cloud standards (25)

## Abstract

The exponential increase in the amounts of data generated in the biomedical sector as well as the vast computational resources required to analyse and integrate them, present veritable barriers to the advancement of science and medicine. The sensitivity of health-related data further requires sophisticated security measures to be in place, which are difficult to implement and maintain in a world of fragmented IT infrastructure as is typically found across hospitals, research centers and industry. To help overcome these obstacles, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), an ...

## Expected outcomes

Rollout of ELIXIR Cloud & AAI platform to first users is planned for the second half of 2020 and, depending on progress, may coincide with BioHackathon. Possible expected outcomes therefore include:
 - Integration of individual components into tool stack via automated deployment recipes
 - User testing / bug hunting
 - Interoperability testing with other GA4GH-compatible clients and services (e.g., workflow or task execution services)
 - Official beta release of integrated tool stack
 - Writing documentation for end users, developers and system admins
 - First steps towards FAIR teaching materials
 - Adding additional features to service components or clients

## Expected audience

Audience:
 - Web developers
 - DevOps
 - End users (biologists/bioinformaticians)
 
 Useful skills:
 - Web development (preferably Python, Go and/or React)
 - REST/HTTP microservices
 - Kubernetes
 - CI/CD
 - OpenID Connect / OAuth2 / AAI

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
