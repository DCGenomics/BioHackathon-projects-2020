# *Project* 25 Exploiting Bioschemas Markup in Community Registries (38)

## Abstract

Bioschemas has the potential to automate the collection of content from the long-tail of scientific resources for community registries such as FAIRDARE for the plant community or Orphanet for the Rare Disease community. This can be achieved by scraping structured markup from the web resources and depositing it with the community registry. This provides a single mechanism to collect data from hundreds of sources with minimal effort from the resource provider; they only need to maintain a website in which schema markup is embedded. However, it requires the registry provider to be able to ...
