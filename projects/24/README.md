# FAIR4Software. Automated indicators and metrics measurement. (24)

## Abstract

Research software are digital objects that depending on the context resemble research data. However, the dynamic nature of research software has led to the community to propose specific instantiations of the FAIR principles for software. Taking into account a number of efforts in this direction, we have implemented in OpenEBench an initial set of indicators and metrics derived from those principles. This non-exhaustive set of metrics and indicators provide the possibility to have a first glance at the FAIRness level of research software across Life Sciences. Measurements are deemed automated ...
