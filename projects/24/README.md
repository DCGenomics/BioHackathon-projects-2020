# *Project* 24 Extending and implementing InterMine databases for ELIXIR nodes (37)

## Abstract

InterMine, an ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resource, collaborated in early 2020 with members from ELIXIR France and ELIXIR Italy to build two InterMine databases based on data from each of those nodes. Over a two-week period, node representatives collaborated to integrate data into the two new InterMine instances, learning how to administer and configure InterMine. This resulted in prototype versions of InterMine known as InterMirMine for ELIXIR Italy, and Genolist for ELIXIR France. During this time the participants also identified extensions to the work done over these two weeks ...
